This repository contains Java and Perl code we used to perform text classification using the WEKA toolkit on the Munich Alcohol Language Corpus (see http://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/Bas/BasALCeng.html for details).
It contains the code we used to achieve our research results, that will be published soon on 2013 Workshop on Emotion and Computing, Konstanz, Germany.

Feel free to use the code to perform classification ALC corpus or just as anspiration on how to use the WEKA datamining 
toolkit programmatically.

Cheers!
